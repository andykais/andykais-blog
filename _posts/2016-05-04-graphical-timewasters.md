title: Blogging Like a Hacker
---


Its a test!
Sorry, for now blogging is out scope of my current knowledge/accomplishments.
I only have limited time and I feel its better spent building cool things than spending too much time researching how to write an interesting blog post.
Perhaps in the future when I feel like I have concise useful tidbits about my experiences to share, I will.
